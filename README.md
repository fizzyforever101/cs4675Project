## Resources:
### IRIS Incidence Response Platform
Website: https://www.dfir-iris.org/

GitHub: https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-web

Documentation: https://docs.dfir-iris.org/latest/

Case Studies of Utilization: https://insec.in/incident-response-101-using-iris-dfir-effectively/

Drawbacks:

> Effective use of the IRIS framework requires a high level of expertise from incident responders, which can be a challenge in organizations with limited cybersecurity staff
> 
> The large amount of data collected and analyzed within the framework can lead to information overload, making it difficult to identify critical details quickly
> 
> While customizable to some extent, it might not readily adapt to the unique security landscape and specific incident types faced by different organizations
> 
> IRIS may struggle with increasingly sophisticated encryption used by attackers, potentially delaying incident response cycle
> 
> Cloud and container environment limitations: IRIS may face challenges in capturing ephemeral data in cloud and container environments, where evidence can quickly disappear
